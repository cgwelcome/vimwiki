== RFID (Radio Frequency identification) ==
Technology which uses radio signal to identify object.
Options:
- Low frequency, 125 - 134.3 kHz
- High frequency, 13.56 MHz

Hardware:
- RC522 RFID Module (Reader, Arduino, High frequency)
- ICLASS SEâ„¢ R40 Reader (Reader, Low and High frequency)
- HID Corporation 1346 ProxKey III Key Fob (Low frequency)
- HID 1326LSSMV HID 1326 PROX CARD II (Low frequency)

== NFC (Near-field communication) ==
NFC is a specialized protocol within the family of RFID technology
It is used for contactless exchange data between devices

Example:
- Mobile payment
- Credit card
- Transit card

== UART ==

serial - a communication method sending one bit at the time
UART - a chip with TX and RX line for serial communication
TTL - a type of logic gate that make up UART
RS-232 - one of the protocols using UART

Example:
- USB to TTL Adapter

== BIOS ==
The program to intializes a computer.
It is stored in a EEPROM chip on the motherboard.
One of common type of BIOS chip is SOIC8 (Small outline integrated circuit with 8 pins)

Example:
- SOIC8 Test Clip with a USB Programmer flash
